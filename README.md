# REN_Template_Project
React, Express, NodeJS template project

# Instructions
- Run npm install in root and then in client folder to install all the dependencies before beginning.
- If everything worked fine, you should see 'Hello World!' on localhost:3000 (react's endpoint)

# Information
- React Front end proxies all the requests to localhost:5000 (change it in client/package.json)
- Server runs on port 5000 (server.js)
- Use "npm run build" to generate production build for client side and then serve static content from server.
